## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# This is where I try to create html from .Rmd

## I am not able to plot a graph yet, but I will

```{r}
breakfast <- c('sauted green beans', 'bread', 'fried chicken', 'pasta', 'granola') #what I eat before class
am_mins <- c(0,15,0,10,12) #how long does it take for me to walk to the lecture classes. '0' means I did not have class on that day
days <- c('Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri') 
icha_unidays <- data.frame(breakfast, am_mins, row.names=days)
icha_unidays
```
